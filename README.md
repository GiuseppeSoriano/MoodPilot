MoodPilot: Combines "mood" and "pilot" to reflect an emphasis on emotional monitoring for improved guidance.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an evaluation system for assessing the mood of passengers in self-driving cars or Uber rides. The system will evaluate the driving capacity of the driver during the trip and determine if the passenger(s) experienced any fear or discomfort. Additionally, passengers will be able to rate their trip experience and provide additional comments if they wish.

## Features

- **Mood Detection**: Analyze passengers' facial expressions and physiological signals to determine their mood during the trip.
- **Driver Evaluation**: Assess the driving performance based on passenger feedback and mood analysis.
- **Trip Rating**: Allow passengers to rate their trip experience at the end of the journey and provide optional comments.
- **Data Collection**: Collect and store data for further analysis and improvement of the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: For mood detection and analysis.
- **Computer Vision**: To analyze facial expressions.
- **Sensors**: To capture physiological signals.
- **Backend**: For data storage and processing.
- **Frontend**: For user interface and trip rating.
